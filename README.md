### Personal Website ###

#### Andrew Eissen ####

This website was designed by Andrew Eissen, and serves as the second iteration of this design. The page is constructed with JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap.JS, Bootstrap CSS Framework, and Python. HTML is generated asynchronously by the "siteBuilder" JS file, and appropriate data is added to the Bootstrap modal through the "click" event listener.

The site is fully responsive, and has been designed to appear attractive on both traditional desktop and mobile screens.

##### Changes from Version 1.0 #####

* The site is now fully coded in JavaScript, replacing the original Python.

* Panels form different composite images of code on a screen depending on mobile or desktop views.

* Code is now loaded asynchronously and minified to reduce loading and rendering time.

* Images have been compressed and correctly sized to further decrease loading time.

* Original png images have been replaced by a single SVG that resizes based on the screen width.

* Quick-click icons at the bottom of the page now respond to mouse-hover events.
